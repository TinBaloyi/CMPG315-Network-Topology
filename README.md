Evaluation of the designed network:
The designed network for the building demonstrates efficient communication, scalability, and management. Here's an evaluation of the implemented network:
1.	Meeting/Server Room:
o	The topology implemented in this room effectively centralizes network management while ensuring isolation between rooms.
o	Having switches and servers centralized allows for easy expansion and fault tolerance.
o	The setup provides a solid foundation for hosting servers and managing network traffic effectively.
2.	Technicians Room:
o	The use of central wireless access points and switches ensures simplicity and scalability.
o	Having the switches connect to each other ensures connectivity and ensures direct access to the machine room.
o	The network design facilitates efficient communication within the room and with other areas of the building.
3.	Meeting Room:
o	Having central switches and wireless devices interconnected with each other cater to the needs of teleconferencing hardware and Wi-Fi access.
o	The setup accommodates many users and devices effectively, ensuring seamless connectivity during meetings.
o	The placement of access points optimizes coverage and connectivity within the room.
4.	Offices:
o	The use of central switches and access points provides simplicity and reliability within each office.
o	Having the switches connect to each other ensures redundancy and connectivity across offices.
o	The network design meets the connectivity needs of office workers while allowing for future expansion.
5.	Floor Space:
o	The topology implemented in the floor space efficiently connects printers, switches, and access points.
o	The use of switches and access points caters to both wired and wireless connectivity requirements.
o	The network design effectively handles the large number of devices in the open floor space while ensuring scalability.
6.	Reception:
o	The topology we used efficiently connects devices in the reception area.
o	The central switch serves as a hub for communication while accommodating devices in the reception/waiting area.
o	The setup allows for centralized management, efficient communication, and scalability.

7.Kitchen:
o   the implemented network topology in the kitchen showcases a thoughtful approach to catering to both wired and wireless connectivity needs while ensuring efficient communication and centralized management.
Overall, the implemented network demonstrates a well-thought-out approach to addressing the diverse requirements of each room while ensuring efficient communication, scalability, and management throughout the building. The use of our topology tailored to the specific needs of each area contributes to a robust and reliable network infrastructure.
The designed network made use of twisted pair copper cables for all the entire building. The maximum segment of such a cable is 100 meters. Hence, it was an ideal choice due to the size of the building (roughly 100 x 50 meters).
Twisted pair copper cables are relatively easy to install and terminate, especially in comparison to fibre optic cables. This can save time and labour costs during the installation process. While Fiber optic cables offer even higher performance, they can be more expensive to install and terminate compared to twisted pair copper cables. For a building of this size, the cost-effectiveness of twisted pair copper cables makes them a practical choice.
Overall, twisted pair copper cabling would provide the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness needed to support the networking requirements of a building of this size.
